# Spaceship-Titanic
The "Spaceship-Titanic" project is a machine learning project that predicts survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic using three popular gradient boosting algorithms: XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. The models are tuned using the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework to improve their accuracy.
